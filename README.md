# Qualitative Goals of our App
## Important Information at a glance

A businessman spends the majority of their time in the office working and seldom has the time to run through uncategorized appointments and events in their calendar. Therefore, important information should be presented to the them upfront by the system. A quick glance at the calendar application should enlist the upcoming appointments, meetings, and events for the day. This would improve the workflow and productivity instead of handicapping it.

##Smooth flow for the layout
A businessman spends a good chunk of time their time interacting with others, either in their office, on-call or in any other place. That is why they have to divide their focus between different tasks. Furthermore, the loss of focus in the middle of a task causes disorientation for the user.  As such, the calendar system must be as interrupt friendly as possible
Users must experience minimal interruptions when navigating through the calendar since businessmen need to work quickly and want results relatively quickly.
Buttons should be well organized according to the sequence of use so as to not strain the user’s memory and to make the user feel as if they are doing a completely natural process that is second nature to them. This also caters to users that may use functionalities very infrequently.
As stated before, to aid productivity and minimize disorientation, the important information should be laid out in the front for easy access.

## Confirmation prompts for certain operations
Since the application will have a touch-based user interface, and the likelihood of accidental touches is high in the cluttered and messy desk of businessmen, the user interface should have confirmation prompts for critical decisions. These include prompts confirming the updating, deleting and sharing of events. 

## Searching of events
One of the key issues with using traditional, table-top calendars is the time associated with searching for a particular appointment, meeting, or event in the calendar. To cater to this, the calendar application must have a search bar that would allow the businessman to search for a particular event by name, location, and time.

## Easy interaction
A user’s motivation to use an application will always depend on how good the interaction is. Businessmen are mostly on the move and have a hectic schedule so the system should cater to them by providing a fast and easy way to input which would be a touch-based experience as opposed to typing everything since not all businessmen are proficient in typing.
Space for optional descriptions provided

One of the issues associated with traditional, table-top calendars is the lack of space to write any pointers or descriptions for an event. To cater for this, the calendar application should provide the option to add optional descriptions, pointers, and reminders for a particular event. 
Standard security requirements met

As the security of business executives’ is placed high on their list of priorities, proper security measures such as two-factor authentication should be provided by the system. As stated during the work environment analysis, various authentication methods should be provided as an option in the main interface so as to showcase the fact that user-security is being granted a top priority. 

## Schedule maker provided
Currently, table-top calendars do not provide a way to organize one’s tasks automatically on a schedule. As such, the calendar application to be designed must include an automatic schedule maker that will generate a list of appointments, events, and meetings for the businessmen. 

## Sharing options are given
Since business tasks in a regular work environment are heavily collaborative, a businessman may need to share their upcoming events with their colleagues to remain on the same page. To cater to this requirement, different sharing options should be provided. 

## Keeping users updated
A businessman has a hectic schedule to deal with and multiple things to focus on. It is a must that the system automatically tracks the events that the user has entered and automatically notify the user when the event date is near.

## Offer customization
Each user may want to give their calendar a different look depending on their preferences. The design should incorporate customizability features that allow for the changing of colours, themes, formatting styles, and more.

## Startup tips and interface tour
The system should provide a proper tutorial that covers all the major features being offered. For expert users, the ability to skip the tutorial should be provided; they should be able to choose to skip instructions regarding a specific screen and learn about another one.
